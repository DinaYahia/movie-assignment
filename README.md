# Go Digital - React Assignment


1. Create an index.html page
2. In the index.html add a form with all necessary inputs to gather movie information (Title, Summary, Year of production, Lead actor, Producer, Genre… etc.)
3. Add to the index.html a section that will be displayed at the right of the screen with the preview of input data
4. Create an index.js script and add to it the necessary code to achieve data binding between form inputs and the preview section
5. Add necessary validations to each input (year of production must be a number with 4 characters, the actors name must not contain numbers… etc.)
6. Create a movie-page.html file and add it as an action to the previous form
